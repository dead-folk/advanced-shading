*An example of a scene using Lit Toon shading.*

kShading is a package of shaders for Unity's Universal Render Pipeline. It includes:
- **Lit:** A physically based shader that supports all default Universal surface properties as well as anisotropy, clear coat, sub-surface scattering and transmission.
- **Toon Lit:** A cel style shader that supports all features of the **Lit** shader but uses a stepped physical approximation BSDF.
